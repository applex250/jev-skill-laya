name: jev-ui
description: Use when a browser or desktop task needs a bounded next-action choice from a fresh text or accessibility observation. Requires a host UI tool; does not install a controller or handle screenshots itself.

# Choose a grounded browser or desktop step

## Setup: choose the service or simulation

This install is adapted to call the local Laya decision service by default:
http://172.27.116.56:8000 (campus network, no API key, no cost). OpenRouter and
TypeSafe remain available via `--provider`; never print credentials. Do not
silently change destination, send data, create an account or switch the host model.

If no route has been chosen, explain the available routes and ask:

> **L — Local Laya (default, already configured):** keyless campus service,
> no cost. The CLI auto-picks the variant per request (classification →
> `english`/`multilingual` by language, `score` → `typed-decisions`); force
> one with `--model`.
> **A — Real Jev:** use/get an OpenRouter key at https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys
> or a TypeSafe key at https://console.typesafe.ai. Configure it locally, not in chat.
> **B — Simulate:** use the current agent, or an explicitly selected available
> model such as DeepSeek, with the same context, questions and criteria.

**Wait for an explicit choice.** Do not ask again for every record in the same
approved task. API errors do not authorize switching providers or simulation.
Missing both keys is not a dead end: offer B. It requires no Jev key but the
chosen agent/model's ordinary access, usage costs and privacy terms still apply.
Do not assume DeepSeek is installed, free or locally hosted.

In B, return `mode: agent_simulation` for the current host or
`mode: model_simulation` for another explicitly approved model, plus its actual
model identity when available and `jev_called: false`. Each question has `value`,
`needs_review`, a brief evidence-based `reason`, `probability: null` and
`confidence: null`. Choice values must be supplied labels, Noul values booleans,
and Score values integer rubric indices. Use null/review for missing evidence.
Never present this as Jev, calibrated probability or equivalent speed/accuracy.
Skip Jev CLI/API steps in B; use the approved model's existing interface and do
not install a substitute or send data elsewhere without consent.

L needs no key or selection: the adapted CLI defaults to `--provider laya`
(http://172.27.116.56:8000/v1/predict); unresolved model IDs auto-route per
the benchmarked decision table (classification by language, scores to
`typed-decisions`). In A, select the destination
explicitly: `--provider openrouter` or `--provider typesafe`. The latter uses
`TYPESAFE_API_KEY` and maps the bundled OpenRouter model ID to `jev-1.13.0`.
`--dry-run` only validates; it neither classifies nor makes a network call.
`setup` reports presence only, not key validity, credits or permission. For guided setup and a copyable
DeepSeek prompt, use `jev-setup` or the [setup guide](https://github.com/wuyoscar/jev-skill/blob/main/skills/jev-setup/SKILL.md).

## Jev API prerequisite and first example

In decision-API mode, this adapted install runs the shared script from the
sibling `jev` skill folder directly (Python 3.10+), defaulting to the local
keyless Laya provider. For OpenRouter or TypeSafe the process must inherit
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`; never place a key in a prompt or
request file.
No sibling skill or third-party integration is required for this judgment.
Actual UI, file, mailbox or simulation actions require the host's own tools.

Resolve `<skill-dir>` to this installed folder. Copy and edit
[assets/example.json](assets/example.json) for the user's task; it is synthetic
input, not a captured successful result. Validate it without a key or API call:

The commands below default to the local keyless Laya service
(http://172.27.116.56:8000, campus network). For OpenRouter or official
TypeSafe, append `--provider openrouter` or `--provider typesafe` to both
validation and live calls.

```bash
python3 <jev-skill-dir>/scripts/jev.py decide <skill-dir>/assets/example.json --dry-run
# After reviewing the input (Laya is the default destination and needs no key):
python3 <jev-skill-dir>/scripts/jev.py decide /path/to/edited-request.json
```

Normal calls send the supplied evidence to the selected provider (Laya stays
inside the campus network at no cost; OpenRouter/TypeSafe incur usage). Read relevant answers, not only the exit code: `0` means selected/scored,
`2` means review, `1` means error. A confidently false Noul is still false;
selection is not permission. Unknown, missing or conflicting evidence needs a
fallback. Test thresholds on the user's task rather than assuming 0.9 is safe.

## Workflow

1. Use an available connector/browser/computer-use tool for observation. Follow its native instructions; Jev receives sufficient relevant text state, not hidden UI or fabricated element IDs.
2. Build candidates only from fresh observed controls and operations actually supported by the host. Prefer an exact known action without Jev when no judgment is needed.
3. Keep known typing values in the host. If text generation is needed, do it separately and validate it before choosing the target.
4. Interpret the selected action, recheck snapshot freshness, execute only a permitted step, and read the result. Do not treat a DONE choice as completion evidence.
5. Return to the host for sensitive actions, consent, stale state or unsupported controls. This skill does not grant browser, desktop or OS permissions.

## Context and parallelism

Jev does not inherit the agent's history. Give every request sufficient context:
the goal, permitted scope, fresh page/accessibility text, observed controls and
their IDs, relevant preceding actions and errors. A list of button IDs alone is
not enough. Remove unrelated page content and secrets without losing task evidence.

Batch independent page-state, candidate-suitability and completion-evidence checks
over the same snapshot instead of serial LLM calls. Use bounded concurrency only
for independent requests, with snapshot IDs, rate limits and a cost/time budget;
the host schedules calls and the CLI has no parallel scheduler. Questions cannot
read other answers in the same request. Do not precompute later clicks using old
state: execute a permitted step and observe its result before dependent decisions.
Jev's low latency helps the judgment stage, not authorization or browser execution.

## Make it yours

Replace the example's evidence, candidate IDs and criteria together. Preserve a
no-match route when the real task can fall outside the labels. Agree on how the
host or person consumes each answer before enabling any automatic effect.
